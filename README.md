# Normal Business Hours
I came to realize recently that I am mostly driven by my feelings, even the most rational thoughts of mine are rooted in an emotional response I first take on things. Maybe I value gut feelings more and more as I grow. So for me, I think itâ€™s important to be in touch with my feelings and listen to what heart desires. And being able to create is what makes my heart happy. Other than that, I found special meanings in spirituality and bonds with loved ones. 
I think I am more of a person to take on a job in a field I am passionate about rather than those that offer more assurance of finance. I am a night owl and honestly I feel like my body only truly awakes after 3pm, but I usually force myself to wake pretty early on weekdays just so I feel productive. I think a middle ground of 10 am to 6 pm would be great. I prefer four days to work in a week, Monday through Thursday. I choose Tanksgiving, Christmas and NYE to take off.
